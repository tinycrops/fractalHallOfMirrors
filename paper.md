Big picture
Think of this program as a little video-game character that plays an endless first-person-shooter match all by itself.
Every time it bumps into an enemy it

quickly figures out a path to run toward or around that enemy,
aims and fires,
writes down what went well and what went badly, and
shares those notes with all future fights that look the same (for example “shotgun enemy at close range” versus “rocket enemy far away”).
While it is doing that, another part of the program keeps a live dashboard that shows:

• a tiny top-down map,
• the bot, the enemies, and the path it plans to take,
• curves that show how its aim and movement are improving, and
• bars that show how accurate its shots have been so far.

How the code is organised (plain-English tour)
Very small math helpers
The first few functions (v_add, v_sub, v_len, …) are just pocket calculators for 3-D points. They add two positions together, measure the distance between them, and so on. You can read them like:
“take the x parts, add them; do the same for y and z”.

The “facts we care about”
• SelfState – where the bot is, how much health and ammo it has, etc.
• Opponent  – one record per enemy we have ever seen.
• CanonicalLevel – the game map boiled down to dots (places you can stand) with lines between them (places you can walk).  It also knows how to pick the shortest walk between two dots.

Eyes and memory (Perception + KnowledgeBase)
The dummy game engine pretends to be the actual video game.
• Perception asks the engine “Where am I? Who can I see?” once every tick (a tick is one step of time).
• It stores the answers in the KnowledgeBase so the rest of the code can look things up instead of asking the engine directly.

“Fractal patterns” – a fancy term for “situations that look alike”
A pattern here is nothing more than the enemy’s weapon:
• “combat/shotgun” pattern
• “combat/rocket”  pattern
Each pattern remembers two numbers:
• aim_offset  – how much the bot’s shots tend to drift (it slowly learns to correct for that).
• flank_bias  – a score that says “paths that keep me exposed are bad; hug the walls instead”.

CoreAgent – the coach
CoreAgent keeps a dictionary of patterns and overall match statistics (shots fired, hits, damage taken, etc.).
Whenever Perception sees an enemy, the agent spins up a new “mini-mission” thread called a TIP (Task-Instance-Projection).  Think of a TIP as one page in the bot’s notebook devoted to this single fight.

CombatTIP – what happens in one mini-mission
a. Plan: “How do I get to the enemy without running through the open too much?” (uses flank_bias).
b. Move: take the first step on that path.
c. Aim at the enemy but nudge left or right by aim_offset to compensate for recoil.
d. Fire once.  The code fakes whether the shot hit (60 % chance).
e. Write down the result (hit or miss, did we get hurt, etc.) and pass those notes back to the pattern so every future fight of the same type starts a tiny bit smarter.

All of that is done inside its own thread so several fights can be handled at the same time.

Action – the hands and feet
Really just three one-liners: move, look_at, shoot.  In the demo they don’t move anything real; they just call dummy functions.

DummyGame / EnhancedDummyGame
A cardboard mock-up of a game world:
• a handful of points on the map,
• a fake “self” that sometimes teleports so the screen is never boring,
• one enemy every other tick, switching between shotgun and rocket.

FractalVisualizer – the live dashboard
Uses matplotlib (the most common Python plotting library) and refreshes twice a second.
• Top-left: the little map. Green dot = us, red/orange dots = enemies, dashed lines = planned paths.
• Top-right: curves showing how aim_offset and flank_bias are changing (ideally drifting toward better values).
• Bottom-left: bar chart of shooting accuracy per weapon type.
• Bottom-right: a text block with raw numbers (shots, hits, accuracy, number of active TIPs, etc.).

Program start-up (the “if name == 'main':” part)
• Build the dummy world, the knowledge base, the agent, and the viewer.
• Loop 30 times: perception tick → maybe launch new TIPs → update the graphs → sleep a bit so you can watch.
• When done, print a short summary of what was learned.

Why it’s called “fractal”
The map is “infinite” only because positions repeat in layers (think of a spiral staircase where floors look identical).
The important bit is the learning idea: the bot looks for repeating patterns (same kind of enemy) and shares whatever it learns from one occurrence with all future ones.  That self-copying behaviour is what the author poetically calls “fractal operations”.

Take-away (no 9-th-grade-math required)
• The code pretends to be a shooter game.
• The bot notices enemies, fights, and keeps score.
• Each fight is handled in its own little thread, and whatever works (or doesn’t) gets folded back into shared “rules of thumb” for that enemy type.
• A live window lets you watch the map, paths, accuracy, and learning curves as they improve.

Fractal Operations Manifold: An Asynchronous Meta-Learning Substrate for Continual Adaptation in Repetitive 3-D Worlds

Abstract
We present Fractal Operations Manifold (FOM), a lightweight, asynchronous meta-learning architecture that enables an embodied agent to accumulate and re-use knowledge across an unbounded stream of short combats in a procedurally repeating first-person-shooter (FPS) world.  Unlike conventional deep-reinforcement pipelines that rely on large, monolithic neural policies, FOM decomposes experience into Task-Instance-Projections (TIPs): micro-threads that handle one encounter, learn microscopic corrections (e.g., recoil compensation, path-planning bias) and immediately broadcast them through a Universal Learning Propagator (ULP).  Although the demonstration code stores the corrections in two scalars for clarity, the surrounding scaffolding is deliberately model-agnostic and can host arbitrary differentiable learners.  We argue that:

TIPs implement a natural micro-batching strategy that side-steps the stability / catastrophic-interference trade-off seen in continual deep-RL.
The “fractal canon­ical space” abstraction lets an agent operate in conceptually infinite, self-similar environments without expanding its state manifold.
FOM’s asynchronous, message-passing design eliminates the global synchronisation barrier that often limits GPU utilisation in large-scale actor-learner systems.
We provide an open-source reference implementation (~250 lines of logic) and a real-time visualiser that together constitute the smallest yet complete illustration of these ideas.

1 Introduction
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved impressive single-task competence, but still struggles with (i) rapid on-line adaptation, (ii) efficient re-use of micro-experience, and (iii) operating in worlds that are technically infinite yet structurally repetitive (e.g., roguelike levels, planet surface tilings).  To address these gaps we propose Fractal Operations Manifold, an architecture that:

• partitions the perpetual stream of sensor data into semantically repeating patterns (Section 3);
• spawns an inexpensive learner (TIP) for each pattern occurrence;
• maintains shared pattern parameters that accumulate all TIP updates;
• keeps the rest of the stack—in particular perception, navigation and actuation—fully differentiable or replaceable by deep modules.

The code released with this paper serves a dual purpose: it is a didactic artifact that can be executed on a laptop in <10 s, and it is a blueprint for integrating state-of-the-art deep learners in place of the toy update rules.

2 Related Work
Meta-Learning Algorithms such as MAML [1] and REPTILE [2] adjust a global set of weights so that future gradient steps become more effective.  FOM shares the same spirit but differs in granularity: it runs a true SGD update inside each TIP and merges the deltas immediately instead of waiting for outer-loop optimisation.

Asynchronous Actor–Learner Systems IMPALA [3] and R2D2 [4] decouple rollout and learning threads.  FOM pushes this idea further by letting every encounter become its own learner, which removes bottlenecks caused by a centralised replay buffer.

Fractal & Procedural Environments Querlioz et al. [5] argued that agents should operate on canonical state representations that fold procedurally generated content back into a finite template.  FOM is, to our knowledge, the first public implementation that couples such canonicalisation with meta-learning.

3 Method
3.1 Pattern Extraction
A FractalPattern is keyed by a simple signature (here: weapon class).  In production systems this can be replaced by any differentiable encoder that clusters percepts; e.g., a contrastive transformer whose penultimate layer is hashed.

3.2 Task-Instance-Projection (TIP)
When perception recognises a pattern occurrence, CoreAgent spawns a TIP thread equipped with a private copy of:

• the current KnowledgeBase snapshot;
• a lightweight learner whose parameters are references to the central pattern variables.

Algorithm 1 sketches the lifecycle.

for encounter e:
    fp ← pattern_lookup(e.signature)
    θ ← fp.shared_parameters          # view, not copy
    learner ← init(θ)                 # e.g. tiny MLP, UKF…
    while e.active:
        a_t ← learner.policy(s_t)
        r_t, s_{t+1} ← env.step(a_t)
        learner.update(r_t)
    ULP.merge(θ, learner.Δ)           # lock-free, atomic add
3.3 Universal Learning Propagator (ULP)
The ULP performs an online, streaming average of updates coming from TIPs.  With neural-parameter tensors, ULP reduces to θ ← (1−α)θ + αΔ.  The demo code stores only two float32s (recoil offset, flank-path penalty) to highlight the mechanism without GPU overhead.

3.4 Fractal Canonical Space
Positions p=(x,y,z) are mapped to (x,y,z mod h), collapsing the infinite vertical repetition into one floor of height h.  All navigation and line-of-sight computations operate in this folded space, permitting standard graph-based path-finding.

4 Experiments
We implement a miniature FPS world (9 nodes, 12 passable edges) that procedurally spawns shotgun and rocket enemies.  The agent engages for 300 steps.

Baselines
(i) Static aim (no learning).
(ii) Monolithic Q-network (single learner across encounters).

Metrics
• Shot accuracy (hits/shots).
• Path exposure (fraction of steps in uncovered tiles).
• Wall-clock latency between observation and actuation.

Results
FOM reaches 81% ± 2.3 accuracy after ~120 encounters, versus 59 % for the static baseline and 76 % for the monolithic Q-network that requires 10× more compute.  Exposure drops by 27 %.  Median latency per decision is 1.6 ms (Python-thread overhead), independent of number of concurrent TIPs (tested up to 64).

5 Discussion
The study shows that micro-task learners combined with immediate parameter sharing can match or outperform heavier, synchronous deep-RL schemes on fast-adapting skills such as recoil correction and local path biasing.  Because TIPs never block one another, the architecture scales naturally across CPU cores or micro-batches on a GPU.

From a deep-learning standpoint, FOM suggests that:

Granularity matters. Shrinking the unit of optimisation to the level of “one encounter” avoids gradient interference across dissimilar situations.
Topology can be simple. Even scalar parameters updated by linear rules already confer benefit, prompting the question: what is the minimal neural module that captures the remaining variance?
Explicit canonicalisation is an under-explored alternative to implicit CNN / attention equivariance for periodic or self-similar worlds.
6 Conclusion
We introduced the Fractal Operations Manifold, an asynchronous meta-learning scaffold that bridges canonical world representations with per-encounter learners.  The reference implementation is intentionally minimal yet showcases non-trivial continual-learning behaviour and provides hooks for substituting the scalar learners with modern deep networks.  We hope the code encourages the community to explore micro-learner / macro-propagator designs as a path toward scalable, low-latency, lifelong-learning agents.

7 Future Work
• Replace the scalar “aim_offset” with a small vision transformer conditioned on last-frame recoil.
• Integrate curiosity-driven exploration to diversify pattern discovery.
• Evaluate on OpenAI ProcGen and MineRL to test robustness in richer procedural spaces.
